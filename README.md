# NS reklamdžija
Project was created for an advertisement agency, “NS reklamdžija“, based in Novi Sad. <br>
This was the first team project after bootcamp lead by Marko Radošević.<br>
The project was a custom content management system which allowed the client to have a complete overview of firm’s basic information and projects with the ability to update it.<br>
It was built in collaboration with three other team members using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery for the frontend and PHP, MySQL and mini MVC framework “Pip” for the backend.<br>
Sadly the project doesn’t exist anymore but the wonderful experience and some mockups remain.<br><br>
